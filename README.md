# Chime
<h3>20-20-20 Rule<br>
Makes window chime every 20 minutes to remind for relaxing the eyes</h3>

<h6>(Only works in Windows)</h6>

<ul>
<li>Uses Visual Basic Script to run the .wav file 
<li>Uses Windows Task Scheduler to routinely run the script every 20 minutes after each logon
</ul>

<p>
Make sure there are no any space in the path folder 
<br>
i.e. 'Sound Location' -> 'Sound_Location'
<br>
This creates problem while running script in Task Scheduler
</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Might create disturbances during meetings or in public
  <li> Requires manual effort to stop the task from Task Scheduler
 </ul>
